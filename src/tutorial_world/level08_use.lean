## Summary
The `use` tactic works on the goal that looks like `⊢ ∃ x, P x`, where the symbol **`∃`** is read as **"there exists"** and
**`P x`** can be understood as **"P is an element of x"**, which could also be written as **`P ∈ x`**.
In this case, the whole goal can be interpreted as **"there exists x such that P is an element of x"**.
Then, the `use` tactic is useful. If we know that an object `a` satisfies the  property `x`, then `use a` 
will simplify the goal into ⊢ P a.

## Example
If your goal is `⊢ ∃ n : natural_numbers, 1 + x = x + n` then `use 1` will 
turn the goal into `⊢ 1 + x = x + 1`, and the rather more unwise `use 0` will 
turn it into the impossible-to-prove `⊢ 1 + x = x + 0`.

## The `use` tactic.

In further proofs, we will need to prove that there exists an object satisfying certain properties.
The goal will then look like `⊢ ∃ x, P x`, where the symbol **`∃`** is read as **"there exists"** and
**`P x`** can be understood as **"P is an element of x"**, which could also be written as **`P ∈ x`**.
In this case, the whole goal can be interpreted as **"there exists x such that P is an element of x"**.
Then, the `use` tactic is useful. If we know that an object `a` satisfies the  property `x`, then `use a` 
will simplify the goal into ⊢ P a.

Let's look at this level to understand it better! Delete the `sorry` to see the goal `⊢ ∃ (ℓ : Line Ω), P ∈ ℓ`.
What does this mean? You can read it as **"there exists a line ℓ that lies in the plane Ω, such that the point P is an element of the line ℓ"**. 
[**Tip:** do a drawing if it feels very abstract to you.] Then, we have to 
find an object **?** that satisfies the property `ℓ`, so that we can type `use ?,` to simplify the goal into 
`⊢ P ∈ ?`. Now, we should take a look at our "Theorem statements" section to ask ourselves if there is any statement
that has a similar structure to the goal `⊢ P ∈ ?`. At this point, I am sure that you thought about `line_through_right`
or `line_through_left`. The statement `⊢ P ∈ line_through P Q` is very similar to that in `⊢ P ∈ ?`, isn't it?

Then, why don't we type `use line_through P Q,`. If you try that, you will see that an error appears. This is
because we don't have such point called Q in this level. We only have one point! And it's called P! What does this mean?
Do we have to create a line that goes from the point P to the point P again? Exactly! You may be wondering how is 
that possible if a line cannot close itself as if it was a circle... in the plane! However, it **is** possible. We have not
defined what is a plane yet! The computer doesn't know how a plane looks like! Because of this reason, you can type `use 
line_through P P,` and see how the goal changes into `⊢ P ∈ line_through P P`. Now, try to finish the proof by your own! It's 
only one more line of code! In case you get stuck, click on the grey box right below to look for a "Hint".

Because the goal is now `⊢ P ∈ line_through P P`, it shows the same structure as `line_through_left` and `line_through_right`
statements. Try any of both to finish the proof by using the `exact` tactic. Remember to type the variables that we are using 
before the comma!
