/- Tactic : exact

## Summary 

If the goal is `⊢ X` then `exact x` will close the goal if
and only if `x` is a term of type `X`. 

## Details

Say `P`, `Q` and `R` are types (i.e., what a mathematician
might think of as either sets or propositions),
and the local context looks like this: 

```
p : P,
h : P → Q,
j : Q → R
⊢ R
```

If you can spot how to make a term of type `R`, then you
can just make it and say you're done using the `exact` tactic
together with the formula you have spotted. For example the
above goal could be solved with

`exact j(h p),`

because `j(h p)` is easily checked to be a term of type `R`
(i.e., an element of the set `R`, or a proof of the proposition `R`).

# Tutorial World

## The `exact` tactic.

In this level, we learn the `exact` tactic, which solves a goal that is exactly one of the hypotheses.
For example, if the finishing goal is ⊢ `A = B` and we have the hypothesis `z : A = B`, then `exact z`
will complete the level.

This level is a new variant of the the previous one, but we will solve it in a different way. As you can imagine, 
mathematical proofs can be solved in many differents ways, which is something that definitely makes this field special.

By using the `rw` tactic you will get the goal to look exactly like one of the hypotheses...
