## Summary

`intro p` will turn a goal `⊢ P → Q` into a hypothesis `p : P`
and goal `⊢ Q`. If `P` and `Q` are sets `intro p` means "let $p$ be an arbitrary element of $P$".
If `P` and `Q` are propositions then `intro p` says "assume $P$ is true". 

## Details

If your goal is a function or an implication `⊢ P → Q` then `intro`
will always make progress. `intro p` turns

`⊢ P → Q`

into 

```
p : P
⊢ Q
```

The opposite tactic to intro is `revert`; given the situation
just above, `revert p` turns the goal back into `⊢ P → Q`.

**Variant:** Instead of calling `intro` multiple times, you can use
`intros`. That is, `intros h₁ h₂` is equivalent to `intro h₁, intro h₂`.

## Example

If your goal is an implication $P\implies Q$ then Lean writes
this as `⊢ P → Q`, and `intro p,` can be thought of as meaning
"let $p$ be a proof of $P$", or more informally "let's assume that
$P$ is true". The goal changes to `⊢ Q` and the hypothesis `p : P`
appears in the local context.

# Tutorial World

## The `intro` tactic.

This level introduces the `intro` tactic. This allows you to create
a new hypothesis in the local context, just above the goal with the `⊢` symbol, whenever you see
the **`→`** symbol in the "goal" section. [**Remember:** the **`→`** symbol refers to the idea of 
an **implication**. `P → Q` is read as "P implies Q" and interpreted as "If P happens, then Q also happens".]  
In Lean, if we have the goal `⊢ IT RAINS → I GET WET`, by typing `intro h` we will get a new hypothesis in 
the local context of the type `h : IT RAINS` and the goal will just change into  `⊢ I GET WET`.

To solve this level, you will need to use a new statement that has been added to the list of "Theorem statements": 

* incidence : P ≠ Q → P ∈ ℓ → Q ∈ ℓ → ℓ = line_through P Q

Now, delete the `sorry` and note how the goal changes into a list of implications. [**Pro tip:** instead of writing 
several lines of code with the `intro` tactic, try to use the `intros` tactic. This will make the computer understand 
that you want to create more than one hypothesis at the same time.] For example, if you type `intros h1 h2 h3 h4,`, four 
new hypotheses will be added to your local context. Once you've added all the possible hypotheses to it, try to compare
the goal with the `incidence` statement. Did you notice that we can `rewrite` that statement? Because we have the first
three **hypotheses** of the statement, we can change the line `r` into `line_through A B`! Type `rw incidence h1 h2 h4,` and 
see how the goal changes. To close the goal, try to apply the same argument to the line `s`.

/- Hint : Click here for a hint, in case you get stuck.
In case you wrote `intros h1 h2 h3 h4 h5,` in the first line, after typing `rw incidence h1 h2 h4,`, click on enter and
write `rw incidence h1 h3 h5,`. Now, the goal should change into `⊢ line_through A B = line_through A B`, but Lean finishes the 
proof for us because it realises that automatically!
