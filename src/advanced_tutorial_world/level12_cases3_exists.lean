## The `cases` tactic (III) (boss level).

Suppose now that your hypothesis says there is some element `x` satisfying a certain
property `P`. That is, you have `h : ∃ x, P x`. Then `cases h with z hz` will
replace `h` with `z : x` and `hz : P z`. That is, from the fact that you assume that
some `z` exists (`z : x`), it will give you another hypothesis in which `z` satisfies the 
property `P` (`hz : P z`).

Let's try to understand this with a real life example! Say that we have the hypothesis 
`h: ∃ GALAXY, SOLAR_SYSTEM GALAXY`. That is, **there exists a GALAXY such that "SOLAR_SYSTEM" is an element of "GALAXY"**. 
Then, `cases h with MILKY_WAY hMILKY_WAY` will break `h` into two goals:
`MILKY_WAY : GALAXY`, which is read as **the "MILKY_WAY" is a term of the type "GALAXY"**, and
`hMILKY_WAY : SOLAR_SYSTEM MILKY_WAY, which is read as **the hypothesis hMILKY_WAY assumes that "SOLAR_SYSTEM"
is an element of the "MILKY_WAY"**. Is it better for you now? [**Tip:** Whenever you don't
understand an abstract concept, try to apply a real life example to it.]

Now, let's try to solve this level! From now on, it will be better if we start by reading the lemma 
as many times as we need to understand it. Then, do a drawing of the situation. In this way, we can
think of a clearer path to close the goal. Once you feel ready, delete the `sorry` and take a look 
to the hypothesis h1 and h2. As you may be thinking, we can apply the `cases` tactic to them. Following
the guiding thread of the real life example, we need to think about a specific line for each of them. 
In geometry, lines are usually represented by the letters `r` and `s`. Then, type `cases h1 with r hr,`, 
click on enter, and write `cases h2 with s hs,`. If you look at the local context, you'll see that we've
assumed that `r` and `s`are lines in the plane Ω. 

Right after, it comes the genius idea. After reading the lemmma and trying to do a draw that represents
the situation, you should be wondering if we could create a hypothesis to state that the lines we've just
added to the local context are the same (`r = s`). Do you remember how we could add a hypothesis? Exactly, 
the `have` tactic will do it for us! Now, type `have H : r = s,` (don't forget the comma).  

Subsequently, we will have to prove two goals. First, try to look for a theorem statement that might help us 
to close the `⊢ r = s` goal. Can you see that `equal_lines_of_contain_two_points` ends with exactly the `r = s`
statement? Then, try to look if we have all the previous implications of this statement in the local context of 
this level. If so, why don't we use the `exact` tactic? [**Pro tip:** Whenever we have a hypothesis of the form
`h : P ∧ Q ∧ R`, we write `h.1` to refer to `P` and we type `h.2` to refer to `Q ∧ R`. If we want to refer to just 
`Q`, we need to write `h.2.1`. Analogously, if we want to refer to just `R`, then we type `h.2.2`. With that being said, 
you can solve the first goal! 

When it comes to the second goal, you should remember what tactic comes handy for solving goals of the form
`⊢ ∃ x, P x`. Once you have it mind, try to use it with the hypotheses `r` or `s`. From there, some `split`'s, `exact`'s 
and a `rewrite` will close the goal.

/- Hint : Click here for a hint, in case you get stuck.
The tactic that comes handy for solving goals of the form `⊢ ∃ x, P x` is the `use` tactic. Type `use r,` and note how the goal 
changes. Now, `split` will break the proof into different goals. Try to close with the `exact` tactic. You may need to use `rw` before
writing the last `exact` that will take you home.
