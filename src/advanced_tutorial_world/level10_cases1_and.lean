/- Tactic : cases

## Summary

`cases` is a tactic which works on hypotheses.
If `h : P ∧ Q` or `h : P ↔ Q` is a hypothesis then `cases h with h1 h2` will remove `h`
from the list of hypotheses and replace it with the "ingredients" of `h`,
i.e. `h1 : P` and `h2 : Q`, or `h1 : P → Q` and `h2 : Q → P`. Also
works with `h : P ∨ Q` and with `h : ∃ x, P x`. 

## Details

How does one prove `P ∧ Q`? The way to do it is to prove `P` and to
prove `Q`. There are hence two ingredients which go into a proof of
`P ∧ Q`, and the `cases` tactic extracts them. 

More precisely, if the local context contains
```
h : P ∧ Q`
```

then after the tactic `cases h with p q,` the local context will
change to
```
p : P,
q : Q
```
and `h` will disappear. 

Similarly `h : P ↔ Q` is proved by proving `P → Q` and `Q → P`,
and `cases h with hpq hqp` will delete our assumption `h` and
replace it with
```
hpq : P → Q,
hqp : Q → P
```

Be warned though -- `rw h` works with `h : P ↔ Q` (`rw` works with
`=` and `↔`), whereas you cannot rewrite with an implication.

`cases` also works with hypotheses of the form `P ∨ Q`. Here the situation
is different however. 
To prove `P ∨ Q` you need to give either a proof of `P` *or* a proof
of `Q`, so if `h : P ∨ Q` then `cases h with p q` will change one goal
into two, one with `p : P` and the other with `q : Q`.

## The `cases` tactic.

The next tactic we introduce is `cases`, and since it does many things
we will have a couple levels seeing when to apply it. This tactic works
always on hypotheses, and it transforms them in different ways. The first
instance that we learn arises when you have a hypothesis that says that `P`
and `Q` holds. That is, you have `h : P ∧ Q`. Then `cases h with h1 h2` will 
replace `h` with two new hypotheses, namely `h1 : P` and `h2 : Q`.

This is done usually for aesthetic reasons, since `h.1` and `h.2` also serve
as proofs of `P` and `Q`.

Knowing that, I'm sure you can complete this level by your own. It's only two lines of code!

/- Hint : Click here for a hint, in case you get stuck.
After typing `cases h2 with hA hB,`, try to look for a theorem statement that may finish the proof.

The line ℓ is the line through P and Q as long as P ≠ Q and both P and Q are in ℓ.
