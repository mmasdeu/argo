## Summary

If `h : P → Q` is a hypothesis, and the goal is `⊢ Q` then
`apply h` changes the goal to `⊢ P`. 

## Details

If you have a function `h : P → Q` and your goal is `⊢ Q`
then `apply h` changes the goal to `⊢ P`. The logic is
simple: if you are trying to create a term of type `Q`,
but `h` is a function which turns terms of type `P` into
terms of type `Q`, then it will suffice to construct a
term of type `P`. A mathematician might say: "we need
to construct an element of $Q$, but we have a function $h:P\to Q$
so it suffices to construct an element of $P$". Or alternatively
"we need to prove $Q$, but we have a proof $h$ that $P\implies Q$
so it suffices to prove $P$".

## The `apply` tactic.

In this level, we introduce the new tactic `apply`. Suppose you are asked to prove a goal of the form `⊢ R` and you have a theorem statement called `h` which 
ensures that `h : P → Q → R`. Then, `apply h` will change your goal into proving `⊢ Q` and `⊢ P`. Now, read the lemma and do a drawing of the situation. Once, 
you're done, delete the 'sorry' and try to look for a theorem statement that ends with the form of the goal shown for this level: `⊢ line_through Q P = line_through P Q`.
Can you see that `incidence` is the right theorem statement to use? Type `apply incidence,` and make an effort to finish the proof on your own.

The tactic that comes handy for solving the three remaining goals is `exact`. You may need to use a theorem statement to
close two of the goals.
