## On the way to the final level (III).

This is the third of five lemmas that we need to prove before jumping into the final level of the game! You will be provided with 
its mathematical proof in paper right below. Remember that you can use all the theorem statements from the left-hand side box.

## Mathematical proof in paper...

**Claim:** Given a line ℓ and the segments A·B and B·C, if both segments are on the same side of ℓ, then `A ∉ ℓ ∧ B ∉ ℓ ∧ C ∉ ℓ`.

**Proof:**

By the lemma `not_in_line_of_same_side_left`, since the points A and B are on the same side of ℓ, then `A ∉ ℓ`.

By the lemma `not_in_line_of_same_side_right`, since the points A and B are on the same side of ℓ, then `B ∉ ℓ`. 

By the lemma `not_in_line_of_same_side_right`, since the points B and C are on the same side of ℓ, then `C ∉ ℓ`. 

Hence, we have shown that `A ∉ ℓ ∧ B ∉ ℓ ∧ C ∉ ℓ`.
